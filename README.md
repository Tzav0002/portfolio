# portfolio
Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those challenges. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

The biggest challenge I faced making my portfolio was the carousel. Since I used Bootstrap for the portfolio, I searched for a Bootstrap carousel. However, I was using Bootstrap 5 and the Bootstrap page on their website was showing me code that only worked for Bootstrap 4. It took a while to figure this out, but once I did, it was a quick fix to insert the Bootstrap 5 code.

One other thing I realized while making the portfolio is that the images are way too big. While making the prototypes, the photos seemed an appropriate size, however in actuality, they are way too large. So next time I will be more mindful in the prototyping stages.

I also changed the "back to top" button to text and not have it a normal button like the prototypes because I thought it fit better with the copyright text at the bottom.

I also didnt add links for the "My Work" banner images since I didn't include those pages in the prototype, only in the site map.







All images are created by me, including the artwork and macrophotography.
